# ImuFusion
## EKF IMU Fusion Algorithms
1. orien.m uses Kalman filter for fusing the gyroscope's and accelerometer's readings to get the IMU's attitude(quaternion).<br>
2. zupt.m implenments the so called 'zero-velocity-update' algorithm for pedestrian tracking(gait tracking), it's also a ekf filter.<br>

## Usage
Example data already included.<br>
Simply run the orien.m or zupt.m. For zupt, set 'CreateVideo' as true if you'd like to save the results as a video.<br>
Note that the datasets and the code for visualizing the results were from:
